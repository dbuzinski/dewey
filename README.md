**Please note:** Don't expect much... YET! This repository is currently in alpha develpoment. It is subject to rapid updates and breaking API changes. But please stay posted. Good stuff is on the way.

## Minimal Doc
Create a file called `train.py`. Define your model, loss, and optimizer(s), and Dew(ey) it up real good! 

Todos:
* nicer skip / checkpoint messaging
* optimize code
* distributed training
* doc
* test
* tensorflow base + checkpoint plugins
* keras base + checkpoint plugins
